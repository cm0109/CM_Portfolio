### Platform: R

### Statistical & Visualization Techniques Utilized:
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Linear Regression
- Multidimensional Ordination

### Analysis Highlight: Microbiome Potential in Forensics!

In this clinical microbiome study, microbial communities from dental plaque of five adult subjects was tracked over a 1-year period. Both the bacterial 16S V1-V3 region and 16-23 Intergenic Spacer Region (ISR) were sequenced for each sample, for species & strain-level community profiling, respectively.

Novel high-resolution ISR sequencing technique combined with DADA2-based processing allowed resolution of individual species into multiple subspecies variants, and revealed highly personalized bacterial profiles for individual subjects.
